This is simple setup to develop website projects using Tailwind. This will be used in my personal website.

## Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Run Tailwind CLI in watch mode

```
npm run watch
```

Now can use tailwind classes in any .html files in the root directory

Put any custom CSS that you may have in the **src/input.css** file

Add any config values to the **tailwind.config.js** file

To build once, run ðŸš€

```
npm run build
```

This HTML and the CSS file (style.css) are already live at https://naandalist.github.io/.
